Create physical volume

{% highlight bash %}
pvcreate /dev/sda4
{% endhighlight %}

Physical volume "/dev/sda4" successfully created

Create a logical volume group called pve

{% highlight bash %}
vgcreate pve /dev/sda4
{% endhighlight %}

Volume group "pve" successfully created

Create volume group
If you really need to assign all space on partition this is the way to do it. This is not a good idea as snapshots will not work.

{% highlight bash %}
lvcreate -l 100%VG -n storage pve
{% endhighlight %}

to use 90%

{% highlight bash %}
lvcreate -l 90%VG -n storage pve
{% endhighlight %}

If you plan to support lvm snapshots do not use 100% space as you need a second lvm volume.

Logical volume "storage" created

Create filesystem

{% highlight bash %}
mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/pve-storage
{% endhighlight %}


Writing superblocks and filesystem accounting information: done

Display your setup

Display Physical volume

{% highlight bash %}
pvdisplay -v -m
{% endhighlight %}


Display Volume group

{% highlight bash %}
vgdisplay
{% endhighlight %}


Display Logical volume

LVM volumes follow the convention: /dev//.

{% highlight bash %}
lvdisplay /dev/pve/storage
{% endhighlight %}


Snapshots

N.B. when LVM2 snapshot, the destination of the backup must be outside the LVM volume that contains the VM you are backing up (i.e. if your VM is in /pve/data that is mounted as /var/lib/vz, you can't save the backup in /var/lib/vz/dump).
